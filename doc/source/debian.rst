Debian Installation
===================

By default, MultiSync is only packaged as a standard Python project, downloadable from `Pypi <https://pypi.python.org>`_.
However, you can create pure Debian packages with `DjangoFloor <http://django-floor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/packaging.html#debian-ubuntu>`_.

The source code provides several Bash scripts:

    * `deb-debian-7-python3.sh`,
    * `deb-debian-8-python3.sh`,
    * `deb-ubuntu-14.04-15.10.sh`.

These scripts are designed to run on basic installation and are split in five steps:

    * update system and install missing packages,
    * create a virtualenv and install all dependencies,
    * package all dependencies,
    * package MultiSync,
    * install all packages and MultiSync, prepare a simple configuration to test.

If everything is ok, you can copy all the .deb packages to your private mirror or to the destination server.
The configuration is set in `/etc/multisync/settings.ini`.
By default, MultiSync is installed with Apache 2.2 (or 2.4) and Supervisor.
You can switch to Nginx or Systemd by tweaking the right `stdeb-XXX.cfg` file.

After installation and configuration, do not forget to create a superuser:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo -u multisync multisync-manage createsuperuser


Default configuration file is `/etc/multisync/settings.ini`.
If you need more complex settings, you can override default values (given in `djangofloor.defaults` and
`multisync.defaults`) by creating a file named `/etc/multisync/settings.py`.




Backup
------

A complete MultiSync installation is made a different kinds of files:

    * the code of your application and its dependencies (you should not have to backup them),
    * static files (as they are provided by the code, you can lost them),
    * configuration files (you can easily recreate it, or you must backup it),
    * database content (you must backup it),
    * user-created files (you must also backup them).

Many backup strategies exist, and you must choose one that fits your needs. We can only propose general-purpose strategies.

We use logrotate to backup the database, with a new file each day.

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo mkdir -p /var/backups/multisync
  sudo chown -r multisync: /var/backups/multisync
  sudo -u multisync -i
  cat << EOF > /etc/multisync/backup_db.conf
  /var/backups/multisync/backup_db.sql.gz {
    daily
    rotate 20
    nocompress
    missingok
    create 640 multisync multisync
    postrotate
    myproject-manage dumpdb | gzip > /var/backups/multisync/backup_db.sql.gz
    endscript
  }
  EOF
  touch /var/backups/multisync/backup_db.sql.gz
  crontab -e
  MAILTO=admin@localhost
  0 1 * * * /usr/local/bin/multisync-manage clearsessions
  0 2 * * * logrotate -f /etc/multisync/backup_db.conf


Backup of the user-created files can be done with rsync, with a full backup each month:
If you have a lot of files to backup, beware of the available disk place!

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo mkdir -p /var/backups/multisync/media
  sudo chown -r multisync: /var/backups/multisync
  cat << EOF > /etc/multisync/backup_media.conf
  /var/backups/multisync/backup_media.tar.gz {
    monthly
    rotate 6
    nocompress
    missingok
    create 640 multisync multisync
    postrotate
    tar -C /var/backups/multisync/media/ -czf /var/backups/multisync/backup_media.tar.gz .
    endscript
  }
  EOF
  touch /var/backups/multisync/backup_media.tar.gz
  crontab -e
  MAILTO=admin@localhost
  0 3 * * * rsync -arltDE ./django_data/data/media/ /var/backups/multisync/media/
  0 5 0 * * logrotate -f /etc/multisync/backup_media.conf

Restoring a backup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  cat /var/backups/multisync/backup_db.sql.gz | gunzip | /usr/local/bin/multisync-manage dbshell
  tar -C ./django_data/data/media/ -xf /var/backups/multisync/backup_media.tar.gz





Monitoring
----------


You can use Nagios checks to monitor several points:

  * connection to the application server (gunicorn or uwsgi):
  * connection to the database servers (PostgreSQL),
  * connection to the reverse-proxy server (apache or nginx),
  * the validity of the SSL certificate (can be combined with the previous check),
  * creation date of the last backup (database and files),
  * living processes for gunicorn, postgresql, apache,
  * standard checks for RAM, disk, swapâ€¦

Here is a sample NRPE configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

  cat << EOF | sudo tee /etc/nagios/nrpe.d/multisync.cfg
  command[multisync_wsgi]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http -H 127.0.0.1 -p 9000
  command[multisync_reverse_proxy]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_http -H localhost -p 80 -e 401
  command[multisync_backup_db]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_file_age -w 172800 -c 432000 /var/backups/multisync/backup_db.sql.gz
  command[multisync_backup_media]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_file_age -w 3024000 -c 6048000 /var/backups/multisync/backup_media.sql.gz
  command[multisync_gunicorn]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_procs -C python -a '/usr/local/bin/multisync-gunicorn'
  EOF

Sentry
~~~~~~

For using Sentry to log errors, you must add `raven.contrib.django.raven_compat` to the installed apps.

.. code-block:: ini

  [global]
  extra_apps = raven.contrib.django.raven_compat
